Predicting life outcomes of a lost pet

This repository contains code and data to train a Gradient Boosting algorithm to predict the outcomes of an orphaned pet.
The training code is written in Python and uses Pandas library to achieve data access similar to the language R, scikit-learn library to preprocess the data and for various ML algorithms. I also used StatsModels library to find out the effective features for classification.
The data has been obtained from a Kaggle competition.
